# 📊 Project Title: *Advanced House Prices Prediction*

## 🏠 Overview

This project predicts house prices using the Ames Housing dataset, showcasing a complete machine learning workflow:

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Raw data is preprocessed and transformed for optimal model performance.
- 🤖 **Model Training:** A linear regression model is trained on the engineered features. Users can also train custom regression models directly within the Streamlit app using their own data.
- 🚀 **Deployment:** The Streamlit web app provides an interactive UI for predictions, custom model training, and basic analysis of results.
- 📊 **Analysis:** The app displays key evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE) and visualizations to help interpret model performance.

The pipeline is designed for reproducibility and flexibility in advanced regression tasks.

## 🔧 Setup and Installation Instructions
### 🅰️ Option 1: Create and activate a virtual environment

#### 🐧 Linux/macOS

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### 🪟 Windows

```bat
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 🅱️ Option 2: Run with Docker

Build and start the app using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t streamlit_app .
docker run --rm -p 8501:8501 streamlit_app
```

Or use the provided shell script:

```bash
bash start.sh
```

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Guide

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Open and run `Data_Cleaning_and_Feature_Engineering_Final_Version.ipynb` to preprocess and engineer features from the raw data.
- Follow up to train a Linear Regression Model on this difficult case.

### 2️⃣ Train Model (if needed)
- Use scripts or notebook to train and save models in `models/` (default model provided).

### 3️⃣ Launch the Streamlit App
- Run the following command or using docker:
    ```bash
    streamlit run main.py
    ```
- Use the sidebar to select between house price prediction and custom regression modules.
- Train your own model on your own data using the custom regression module.

## 📊 Results

- **Predictions:** 🏡 View predicted house prices in the Streamlit app UI.
- **Model:** 🤖 The trained linear regression model is stored in `models/linear_regression_model.pkl`.
- **Data:** 🗂️ Cleaned datasets are in `data/new_train.csv` and `data/new_test.csv`.
- **Notebook:** 📓 All preprocessing and feature engineering steps are documented in the notebook.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**  
    - *📉 Mean Absolute Error (MAE):* Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual prices. Lower values indicate better accuracy.
    - *📈 Mean Squared Error (MSE):* Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual prices. It penalizes larger errors more than MAE.  
        **Notebook Result:** 711,102,117.35 MSE
